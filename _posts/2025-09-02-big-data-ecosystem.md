## What is Hive?

Apache Hive is a **data warehouse system** built on top of Hadoop.

It provides an SQL-like interface (HiveQL) to query data stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) or other compatible storage systems.

Hive itself is not a database — it doesn’t store the data; rather, it stores metadata about the data (schemas, tables, partitions) in a Metastore (usually backed by MySQL/Postgres).

When you run a query in Hive, it translates your SQL-like query into MapReduce/Spark/Tez jobs under the hood.

In short: Hive = **SQL on top of Hadoop/Spark for querying big data**.


## What is S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a **cloud object storage service** provided by AWS.

- It’s one of the most widely used storage systems in the world.
- You can store any type of data: documents, images, videos, backups, logs, analytics datasets, etc.
- It’s designed for durability, scalability, and availability.

Think of S3 as an infinite hard drive in the cloud — you can dump raw files in, and AWS will manage the infrastructure, scaling, and redundancy for you.


## Hive vs. S3

| Feature      | **Hive**                                                                 | **S3**                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**     | Data warehouse / query engine (metadata + SQL interface)                 | Object storage service                                        |
| **Storage**  | Does not store data itself, but uses HDFS, S3, or other storage backends | Stores raw files (CSV, Parquet, JSON, ORC, etc.) as objects   |
| **Querying** | SQL-like queries via HiveQL                                              | Cannot query directly (needs Athena, Presto, or Spark)        |
| **Schema**   | Provides schema on top of raw files (“schema on read”)                   | Schema-less — just stores files                               |
| **Use case** | Structured queries, analytics on big data                                | Durable, scalable storage of raw/unstructured/structured data |


You can actually store Hive tables in S3. The data lives in S3, and Hive just defines the schema and provides the SQL query interface.

Hive is not storage → it’s a **querying layer** (SQL on top of big data).

S3 is storage only → it needs a query engine (Athena, Hive, Spark, Presto, etc.).

Hive is useful when you already have Hadoop/Spark infrastructure and want SQL access.

In modern cloud environments, people often use Athena (AWS), BigQuery (GCP), or Snowflake instead of Hive, because they’re fully managed, faster, and easier.
