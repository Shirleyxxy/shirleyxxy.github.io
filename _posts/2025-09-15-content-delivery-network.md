## What is CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers designed to deliver web content and digital assets (like images, videos, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files) quickly and reliably to users.


### Core Idea

- Instead of all users requesting content from a single origin server (which may be far away or overloaded), a CDN caches copies of content on edge servers located in data centers around the world.
- When a user requests a webpage or media file, the CDN directs them to the nearest server (geographically or in terms of network latency).
- This reduces latency, improves load times, and helps handle high traffic efficiently.

### Examples

- Akamai, Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Fastly, Google Cloud CDN are popular CDN providers.
- Video platforms like Netflix and YouTube rely heavily on CDNs to stream content smoothly worldwide.
- E-commerce and news sites use CDNs to ensure pages load fast for customers everywhere.
